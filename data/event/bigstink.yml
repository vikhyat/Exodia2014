  Summary:
    Let us a create a amall world inside this world which will reflect this
    world the same way as a drop of water reflects the landscape." Come
    with the social issues you want to eradicate from this society.
    It is to introduce more students to the raw and pedestrian, by socially
    relevant and effective form of theatre, street play or ‘nukkad naatak’. A
    street play is very different from mainstream theatre, mainly because
    it is performed outdoors, and not on a stage. A street play usually
    targets a crowd in a public place; the actors perform with audience on
    all sides. It takes up socially relevant subjects, mainly the issues
    that plague the society.
