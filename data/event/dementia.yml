  Summary:
    <strong>“ Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”</strong><br>

    With a large number of programming languages at your disposal, it’s just you - the warrior, your language - the weapon and mind boggling problems - the treasure to be won. ACM Student Chapter, we hereby bring Dementia right in front of you to be grabbed sitting in your cosy couch. It will be an online programming competition with a certain set of problem statements to be solved within a given time limit. 
  Rules:
    <strong>1)</strong> The competition is for individuals. No teams are allowed.<br>
    <strong>2)</strong> There is no restriction on the programming language to be used.<br>
    <strong>3)</strong> This competition is only for students, hence no professionals are allowed.<br>

    <strong>4)</strong> You will receive one point for solving a problem (passing all test cases - no partial credit), regardless of the level of difficulty of that problem.<br>
    <strong>5)</strong> Users are ranked according to the most problems solved. Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order of time.<br>
    <strong>6)</strong> The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.
