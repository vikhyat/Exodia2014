  Summary: "The map is set and the path is discovered. Clear up your brains, get your stuff together and set sail to
	break the Resistance in you and achieve more than you’re Capacitance. Get your IC guns ready and
	break all ill-logical Gates to achieve that memorable glory.<br>
	Your path will be blocked by circuits and riddles. You have to conquer all to reach the other end. The
	other end has a box guarded by a super circuit. Solve it, break the code and get out of the field."

  Rules:
    "<strong>1)</strong>There will be four circuits and riddles to solve in all and a final super circuit.
	<br><strong>1)</strong>The solution to the riddle gives you a hint or answer to the circuit.
	<br><strong>2)</strong>The circuit is up and running but you have to cut it down by adding certain pieces of circuit 
	components (not altering the circuit at all).
	<br><strong>3)</strong>You cannot break the circuit. It must be complete but only the component we wish to stop must not
	work on addition of any further components.
	<br><strong>4)</strong>You cannot short circuit the components.
	<br><strong>5)</strong>Components/ tools will be provided by organizers. 
	<br><strong>6)</strong>You can add as many components you want but only from those provided by the organizer.
	<br><strong>7)</strong>You can solve the circuits in any order you want but you solve the super circuit only after you have 
	solved the rest.
	<br><strong>8)</strong>In case of disputes organizer’s decision is final." 
  
  Conditions: "<strong>1)</strong>Team size of up to 5 is allowed.
