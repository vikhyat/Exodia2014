  Summary:
    The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did not exist. It should come as no surprise that he must have had one
    fine advocate. Come and participate in a debate which gets uglier by the second and
    see if you are the one to survive. Make your devils win in exchange for a fair reward.
  Rules:
    <strong>1)</strong> You will be judged upon the quality and depth of your argument and on your excellent use of the English vocabulary.<br>
    <strong>2)</strong> You may question your opponents on personal grounds to prove your point.<br>

    <strong>3)</strong> You may express disagreement with the judge's opinion during and/or at the end of the debate.<br>

    <strong>4)</strong> You many not argue with the moderators. They possess the right to stop you from arguing further if they
    feel it is appropriate.<br>

    <strong>5)</strong> The decision of the judges will be final and binding.<br>

    <strong>Format</strong><br>
    The debate will be divided into one or more rounds of about 30 minutes each.
