  Summary:
    <strong>Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.</strong><br>

    Bingo! Plato… the perfect sense of the sky above all of us is to take us to a realm not foreseen
    by any and lets us to dive in the vast vacuum of imagination. It is the one thing
    that all share the common thread that runs through all and leave us contemplating.<br>

    <strong>Are we alone?</strong><br>
    What are those great heavenly bodies meant for? Why to leave this puny Earth with
    us on it? Perhaps in the great scheme someone wants to admire the beauty above and
    the unimaginable helm the Power is at. So let’s admire that alluring sky and be
    mesmerized with the experience of beholding the sight of the creations of which
    only NASA has been a witness of.  We welcome
    you all to the Sky Gazing Event at Exodia’14, the event which does not end up with
    any loser but winners only and with Peace for The Primal Self.<br>
    <strong>P.S. Just come with an open mind and Eyes</strong>
