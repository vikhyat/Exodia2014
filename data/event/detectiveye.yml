  Summary:
    <strong>The event helps discover the detective hidden within you</strong> <br>

    A team of two would be sent into a room to
    observe it and uncover clues leading to the answer to the question given to
    them (one of many questions - Where's your wife?").<br>

    Teams would compete against each other in time and the accuracy of their answer.
    There will be two (or three, in case number of teams are too many to be
    selected for the second round) rounds, each qualifying teams for the next.<br>

    The rounds are<br>

    <strong>•Round 1</strong> The contesting team would be introduced to a room for a given time frame for them
    to observe the room carefully. The team would be taken to a room which would
    have slight differences over the previous. These differences would be the clues
    leading to their answer.<br>

    <strong>•Round 2</strong> The contesting team would be introduced to a room for
    a given time frame for them to observe the room carefully. The team would have
    to observe the room (this time just one room). The objects around,the state of
    the objects around and the condition of the rooms would be clues leading them
    to the answer.
