  Summary:
    Long ago there was time when people like
    Leonardo used to make mechanical marvels like
    metal fly and wind up lion, which were very elaborate
    with complex systems of gears and springs.
    The Battle of Troy began when Greeks sail across
    the sea with their Boats. Combining the two and
    bringing the golden era of wind-up-toys.
    Exodia invites you to sail across the sea with your
    own boat.Bring yourself with intelligence and
    generosity of Leonardo Da Vinci to unfurl your
    flag on the land of Troy.<br>
