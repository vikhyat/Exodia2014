    “You have a Minute to win it.”

    This is a game similar to the American primetime game show.

    In this game the contestants form teams of two and complete a given challenge, obviously within a
    minute.
  Rules:
    <strong>1)</strong>Each challenge must be completed within a minute in order to advance to the next round.<br>
    <strong>2)</strong>If a team is found to be cheating in any way to complete a challenge, they will be automatically eliminated from the entire competition.<br>

    <strong>3)</strong>There will be three rounds-<br>

    <strong>a)</strong>Eliminators (Cap- 20 teams)<br>

    <strong>b)</strong>Eliminators (Max/Top 10 teams)<br>

    <strong>c)</strong>Finals (Max/Top 2 teams)<br>

    All decisions by the judges are final.<br>

    <strong>4)</strong>Each team of two will be given 1 life in the eliminators and 2 lives in the finals."<br>
