  Summary:
    <strong>“Ask any racer, any real racer. It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile; winning's winning.” 
    ―The Fast and The Furious</strong><br>
    Got thirst for speed? Then speed is what you’ll get. This March every limit shall be breached, every 
    hurdle conquered, every tyre burned down, every drop of fuel guzzled as these speed demons blaze 
    through the vicious turns and tantalizing straights of the booby trap riddled track that awaits; you know
    you just can’t sit back in awe. Fabricate a wirelessly controlled car powered by an IC engine and be a 
    part of the frenzy.
    Rev up the engines. Glory awaits this March, at Nitro Blaze.
