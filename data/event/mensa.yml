  Summary: <strong>Lose your mind and come to your senses</strong><br>
           Our life is full of trivial things , which are still not as trivial as we perceive. From remembering to buy fruits which your friend asked you to buy while returning back , to recalling phone numbers, to being a good listener in workplace or correctly remembering the names of people around you it does matter a lot when it comes to our overall efficiency of handling any work be it academics or otherwise.
