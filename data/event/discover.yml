  Summary:
    <strong>“To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.” ― Thomas A. Edison</strong><br>
    As said by Sir Thomas Edison, in this event we will be providing you with the pile of junk, not literally though. The junk being jumbled cut-pieces of image of a scientific object, where participants would use their imagination skills to guess the object. Not just that, you will also be required to use your innovative skills to write some scientific process that pertains to the object. So, this event will eventually test your imagination, innovative skills and knowledge. So be prepared with a subtle mind and the knowledge about scientists along with their inventions as that’s what we’ll test in the next round.<br>
    The two rounds of this event are :<br>
    <strong>Imaginoception Round</strong> In this round, participants would be given 7 questions. Each question would have 9 cut-offs and randomly arranged parts of a picture of a scientific object and the participant is expected to arrange them properly after which they would have to write the main scientific principle and some scientific process with respect to that that object.<br>
    <strong>Discover Round</strong> A knowledge based round in which you would require the knowledge about inventors (name and faces) along with their inventions. There would be 8 questions in which you will be given the image of an inventor and some images of inventions and you are required to identify his name and his invention correctly.<br>
