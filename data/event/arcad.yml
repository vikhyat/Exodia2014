  Summary:
    arCAD is the paradigm for the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square 
    holes, the one who sees things differently, they are not fond of the rules and have no respect for the 
    status quo. This event is the ideal platform for students having an appetite for designing, to apply their
    skills and knowledge to come up with creative and original solutions to the problems put forth.
    Unleash your engineering skills, creativity and intuition, and structure your ideas into a well-defined 
    3D model for design problems. The challenge is to design a product keeping in mind its form and 
    function, aesthetics and ergonomics with no compromise on its user-friendliness. May the best design
    win!
  Task:
    Present your skill as an engineering designer with the use of CAD software to ideate, conceptualize 
    and present desired tool or mechanism.
